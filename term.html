		<h2>Legal Terms for Educators and Institutions</h2>
		<p><b>COLLEGE BOARD “RULES OF THE ROAD” FOR EDUCATORS AND INSTITUTIONS</b><br>
		<br>
			These legal terms (<b><i>“Terms”</i></b>) govern the use of products and services (collectively, 
			“<b><i>College Board Educator Services</i></b>”) that College Board (<b><i>“we”, “us” or “College Board”</i></b>)
			makes available to authorized users of colleges, K-12 schools, school districts, state
			education agencies, scholarship organizations and certain other education institutions
			and agencies (collectively, <b><i>“Institutions”</i></b>). Authorized users are educators, teachers,
			testing staff for school day test administrations,  and others who use College Board
			Educator Services on behalf of and with the authorization of their respective 
			Institutions (collectively, <b><i>“Education Professionals” or “Educators”</i></b>). Education
			Professionals also include employees and agents of service providers to Institutions 
			who access College Board Educator Services at the direction of and for the sole 
			purpose of providing services to Institutions. Education Professionals and Institutions
			will be collectively referred to in these Terms as <b><i>“you” or “your” or “their”.</i></b>
			College Board Educator Services are made available to Education Professionals 
			solely in their capacity as authorized representatives of their respective Institutions
			and are not for their personal use. By using College Board Educator Services, you 
			represent that you have been authorized by your current Institution to use College
			Board Educator Services (including access to student data, where applicable) and you 
			agree that these Terms govern both you and your Institution unless otherwise prohibited
			by applicable law. If your Institution has a separate contract with us governing the 
			use of one or more College Board Professional Educator Services (a <b><i>“Negotiated Agreement”</i></b>),
			the Negotiated Agreement will control in the event of any inconsistency with these Terms. 
			These Terms amend and replace the “Site Terms of Use.” These Terms also govern testing 
			staff for SAT weekend test administrations  (<b><i>“Weekend Testing Staff”</i></b>). Weekend Testing
			Staff are included in the definition of “you” or “your” or “their”.</p>
